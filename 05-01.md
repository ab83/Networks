# Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

Symmetric Encryption - A type of encryption when the secret key has to be agreed on ahead of time by two people in private. Sender and receiver share the same key to unlock the cypher. However, there is a problem with sharing the key over the internet because it is public.

Asymmetric Encryption - A type of encryption where there is a public key that is shared with anybody and a private key that is not shared. Public key is used to encrypt the data, but it can only be viewed by someone who has a private key. Pretty much, you can send each other encrypted mail but only the computer with the secret key thatâ€™s not shared can open it.
